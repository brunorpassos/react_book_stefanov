This is a study from the Stefanov's book "React: Up & Running".
And I promise that I'll format this README appropriately.

Chapter 1

First of all, you've to notice that the book tells you to download a "Starter Kit"
from the github page. But you won't find that .zip file there. Instead of using
NPM or another package manager, I'll use CDN as a start.

'''src="https://unpkg.com/react@latest/dist/react.js"
src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@latest/dist/react-dom.js"
src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"'''
